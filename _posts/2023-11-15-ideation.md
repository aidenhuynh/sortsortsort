## SASS
- Wireframe: (pending)

## Fibonacci
- something or other
- Different loops under the same class (methods & inheritance)

## Sorting
- bubble
- insertion
- selection
- merge
- l

## Inheritance
- We will be using interfaces or an abstract class
- Share user inputted array, size

## Analyze
- Count times of all methods, different page for comparing average ratios for time
    * "On average, selection sort is 1.5x faster than bubble sort" or something
